# INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE COVID-19 VIRUS

This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality in Kenya between 2020 and 2024, with a focus on both direct COVID-19 deaths and the indirect mortality burden caused by the health system disruptions.

By analyzing trends in other major causes of death such as TB, HIV, malaria, and non-communicable diseases; the project seeks to understand how the pandemic strained health services and contributed to excess deaths beyond COVID-19 itself.

Through statistical modeling, geospatial mapping, and visualization, the analysis highlights not only when and where COVID-19 peaks occurred, but also how indirect effects were distributed across urban and rural counties, providing insights for health system resilience and preparedness for future pandemics. 


## OBJECTIVES 
*1. What were the trends in direct COVID-19 mortality in Kenya between 2020 and 2024?*

*2. How did mortality from other major causes (e.g., TB,HIV, malaria, non-communicable diseases) change during the pandemic period?*

*3. Are there observable peaks in COVID-199 deaths, and how do they align with known pandemic waves in Kenya?*

*4. To what extent did indirect mortality increase due to health system disruptions during the pandemic?*

*5. Were indirect mortality effects more concentrated in urban or rural counties?*

*6. Which demographic groups (age, gender) were most affected by direct and indirect pandemic-related mortality?*

*7.What insights can be drawn to strengthen Kenyaâ€™s health system resilience and preparedness for future pandemics?*
